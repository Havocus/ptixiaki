// INSTALATION INSTRUCTIONS



Node.js & npm: The application is based on Node.js, so you need to install Node.js along with npm (Node Package Manager). These are used to run the application and manage its dependencies.

For Ubuntu/Debian:


sudo apt update
sudo apt install nodejs npm

For Windows: Visit the official Node.js website and download the latest version. Follow the installation guide provided.

Install Git
If the application code is hosted in a repository like GitHub, you need to install Git to clone the repository.

For Ubuntu/Debian:


sudo apt install git
Clone the Repository
After Git is installed, use the following command to clone the application repository to your local machine:


git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
cd repository-name
This command will download the application code and place you in the application's directory.

Install Dependencies
Once the repository is cloned, you need to install the application's dependencies. This can be done using the following command:


npm install
This command reads the package.json file and installs all the necessary packages required for the application to function.

Configure Environment Variables
If the application uses environment variables (such as database information or API keys), you need to set them up properly. Create a .env file in the application's directory with the following command:

touch .env

Fill in the necessary variables in this file.

Start the Application
After completing the above steps, you can start the application locally using the following command:


npm start
Access the Application
Finally, to access the application, open your web browser and go to:


http://localhost:(PORT)
Replace (PORT) with the port number specified in your application (usually defined in your code or package.json).

This will allow you to run and test your Node.js/Express application locally.
